# Data processing and visualization course - Project

## Overview

The goal is to get to know python as a tool for **plotting data** and performing
**statistical operations** utilizing various modules.
To that end, we (the students) were provided with **sample dataset** of accidents
that happened in the Czech Republic since 2016 until 2022.

The total assignment is to work on three increasingly extensive sub-assignments:
* part01 - Get to know **matplotlib** and **numpy** (intro, not relevant to the mentioned dataset): 
  * `part01.py` - Main script, run to see the results (figures are only saved by default)
  * `test_part01.py` - Pytest simple tests for `part01.py`
  * `tmp_fn.png` and `tmp_sin.png` - Output graphs of part01

* part02 - Work with **pandas** and **seaborn**:
  * `analysis.py` - Main script, run to see the results
  * `*.png` files - part02 per-subtask results
  * `data/data.zip` - Zip archive containing source data  

* part03 - Plot also geographic data and evaluate statistical hypotheses.
Also, optionally, prepare a custom report with documentation about the data used in this part:
  * **_TODO_**


### The assignment documents (Specification for the tasks)
The assignment documents can be found in their respective `partXX` folder named either
as `zadani.pdf` or `nehody-zadani.pdf`. 
Please note that the assignment documents (handed out by the professor at BUT)
are only available in the Czech language. 

An Excel spreadsheet, that explains the dataset this project is working with
can be found in the `docs/` folder.
